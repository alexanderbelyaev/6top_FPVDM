atlas -> 139fb^-1, CMS->137^-1
===============================================
SR to combine:
atlas_2211_08028 : 139fb-1; 0 or 1lepton ; at least 3 b-jets
SR-Gtb-C, SR-Gtb-M,SR-Gtb-B: all-hadronic final states (gluino to tb)
SR-Gbb-C, SR-Gbb-M: all-hadronic final states (gluino to bb)
SR-Gtt-0L-B:  all-hadronic final states (gluino to tt)
SR-Gtt-1L-M1: 1 lepton  final states (gluino to tt)


CMS SUS-19-005
SRs are mutually exclusive by design because:
CMS uses binning strategy: each event falls into exactly one bin in 
the multidimensional space (Njets, Nb-tags, HT, MT2).
These are combined in CMS global likelihood fits -- strong evidence of independence.
Safe to combine all SRs within CMS SUS-19-005 
(CheckMATE does this internally by taking max-likelihood).
This is the easiest case.

ATLAS 2010.14293
Many SRs are inclusive in terms of thresholds (e.g., meff > 2200 GeV includes meff > 2000 GeV).
Events can pass multiple SRs -- nested structure.
Cannot combine all SRs.

ATLAS 1908.03122 -- overlapping SR sets; safest to use only the strongest individual SR


ATLAS 2101.01629
SRs are mutually exclusive by design (confirmed in text).
Safe to combine all SRs.


CMS 1908.04722
CMS search with multi-jet + 1 b-tag categories.
SRs defined for different jet multiplicities and HT bins.
Strategy similar to CMS SUS-19-005-- likely exclusive.
Need to check: The paper states -- binning strategy ensures orthogonality
Status:
Likely safe to combine all SRs 


ATLAS 1709.04183
Older ATLAS SUSY search (multi-jet).
Based on past ATLAS practice (2017), 
these SRs are not orthogonal.Use best SR only.

ATLAS 2106.09609
Search with machine-learning-based SRs.
SR definitions partially overlap (NN score bins).
ATLAS warns about overlap in text.
Official combination uses correlation info (not public).
Status:Cannot combine SRs.Use best SR only.


ATLAS 2004.14060
Stop search with three main SRs (different mass scenarios).
These SRs are mutually exclusive by construction 
(each scenario uses different lepton/jet/b-tag cuts).
Verified in text: SRs defined to be orthogonal.
